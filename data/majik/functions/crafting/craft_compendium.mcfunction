This book will be your handy guide to crafting and conjuring spells, and other magical phenomena. Before we get started, let us cover the basics."}', '{"text":"Firstly, it is important to note that knowledge is power, and thus your experience bar acts as a mana bar as well.\\n  Secondly, many different items all over the world have different magical properties. Be sure to especially stock up on on paper and flowers."}', '{"text":" Your first step to learning magic is crafting a compendium. If you are reading this, you should already know how, but in case you do not remember, simply place a book in an item frame located above an enchanting table. Magical energies will leak into the book, and fill it with secrets."}', '{"text":" Crafting spells is a similar process. Place a spell recipe in an item frame above a block of lapis lazuli, and crafting will begin. Toss whatever ingredients the spell requires near the item frame, and your spell should be complete."}', '{"text":" It is also important to note that all spells require a stick as a crafting ingredient for binding. Simpler spells will require less materials, whereas more complex spells--which have been deemed as level two spells--will require more materials."}', '{"text":" Finally, to cast a spell, simply grab the crafted wand out of the item frame, ensure you have enough mana to cast it, and keep a slip of paper in your inventory. Then right click, and your spell should cast."}', '{"text":" Paper acts as a spell scroll when cast, and is used for positioning a spell. When casting, paper will always be tossed out, and different spells will be cast from it. Moving this paper will move where the spell may be cast, and destroying it may cancel the spell."}', '{"text":"Components\\n Spells themselves and their recipes are composed of two components--shapes and elements. Shapes change how the spell is channeled and handled, and elements are the medium at which is channeled."}', '{"text":"Shape - Self\\n Self spells are somewhat simple yet quite effective. They cast the element onto you, though whether this effect is adverse or beneficial depends on the elements.”}', '{"text":” Self spells require a clay ball and raw cod fish as spell ingredients, and are simply labeled as SELF (all lowercase) within spell recipes."}', '{"text":"Shape - Projectile\\n Projectile spells are also simple. These take the shape of magical bolts or fireballs, inflicting their effect upon coming close to entities."}', '{"text":" Projectile spells require a snowball and an arrow within crafting, and are labeled PROJECTILE within recipes."}', '{"text":"Shape - Beam\\n Beam spells channel the given elements in a short-yet-concentrated distance infront of you. They are powerful, but require additional work to channel..."}', '{"text":"...because these spells are so strong, they also require additional materials to craft, deeming them Level Two spells."}', '{“text”:” Beam spells require an unused bow and iron sword to craft, and are simply labeled BEAM in recipes. They also will move the paper to the end of their cast length, allowing for a nice combination of point spells.”}', '{"text":"Shape - Point\\n Point spells are the most powerful cast, but are often a little delayed due to the time it takes to channel them. What is unique about point spells is that they are tied to the paper."}', '{"text":"This means that you can cast one and leave before feeling its potentially adverse effects.\\n Point spells are labeled as POINT within recipes, and require TNT and a redstone torch as ingredients."}', '{"text":"Element - Fire\\n Fire spells are the most straight-forward, setting things on fire and causing creatures to wither slightly from its painful effects."}', '{"text":" The fire element is labeled as FIRE (again, all lowercase for elements too), and requires a torch and a dandelion as ingredients, plus an additional fire charge for level two spells."}', '{"text":"Element - Frost\\n Frost spells are fairly straight-forward as well, but do not damage entities. Instead, they freeze water and slow enemies to a crawl, which can prove useful in certain situations."}', '{"text":" Frost spells are labeled as FROST, and require a snow block and a white tulip, as well as an additional Lily of the Valley and block of packed ice in level two spells."}', '{"text":"Element - Lightning\\n Lightning spells are more finicky yet very powerful. They deal lots of direct damage to multiple targets within a concentrated area, but cast oddly and can result in harming yourself quite a bit."}', '{"text":" Lightning spells are labeled LIGHTNING in spell recipes, and require a gold sword and blue orchid, as well as an additional nether quartz and glowstone dust in level two spells."}', '{"text":"Element - Nature\\n Nature spells are gentle and mild, yet require lots of mana to cast. They heal their targets and damage undead, but cast in small areas."}', '{"text":" Nature spells are labeled as NATURE in recipes, and require a poppy, glistering melon slice, and a cactus, as well as an additional ghast tear and non-enchanted golden apple in level two spells."}', '{"text":"abc"}', '{"text":"End of Spell Section"}', '{"text":"Magical Mobs\\n With these powerful arcane energies in the air comes great dangers as well, however. You will occasionally run into hostile mobs that are equally adept at spell casting."}', '{"text":" These mobs can be very dangerous and harmful, but drop important spell materials used in crafting level two spells, so it is good to keep an eye out for them."}', '{"text":"abc"}'],title:"Arcane Compendium",author:"version 1.00"}}
